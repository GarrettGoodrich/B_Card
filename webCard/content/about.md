# Hello,

I'm Garrett, a professional software engineer and recent computer science major. Iâ€™m proficient
in Python and C++, and familiar with web development in Html, CSS, and javascript. My goal is
to further expand my knowledge in software development.


## Linux and Coding
---

- I was introduced to Linux at the age of nine. My uncle installed Ubuntu on an old computer and gave it to me to try. Suffice to say I was not impressed, but as I got older I returned to using Linux with [zorin][5]. I was surprised at how fast and stable it was compared to windows. Over the years I have learned valuable information on how Linux works which aided me with learning how to code. 


- As an avid gamer, I wanted to know how games were made. In middle school, I picked up a book on python and started messing around with its interpreter. There was a lot of new terminology that I did not understand at the time. Variables, data types, function definitions, and classes were all foreign to me. I felt like a wizard printing messages to the terminal doing basic arithmetic with python. Familiarizing myself with a programming language aided me throughout high school and college and was a invaluable experience.

## Other Interests:

- ### 3d Printing

    - After 3d printing in class during high school, I was so interested in it, I decided to make ([a dlp printer][1]) using only [instructions][3] I found online. I was already learning how to design schematics in Autodesk Inventor at the time. Ever since then, I've been tinkering with 3d printing.
