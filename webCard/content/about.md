# Greetings, Web Traveler:

I'm Garrett, and I am a professional computer science major and graduate who is also into tinkering. I am proficient in Python and C++, and I'm familar with web development(work in progress). It is my goal to further expand my knowledge in software development. 

## **Hobbies:**

- ### Hardware

    - I build custom computers and repurpose older ones as servers. Examples include reusing older hardware as a nas server using [truenas][4].

- ### 3d Printing

    - My engineering teacher in high school introduced me to the wonderful world of 3d printing. He bought a [pla printer][2] for the class use since we were learning how to design schematics in autodesk inventor. I was so interested in it, I decided to homemake one using some [online instructions][3] and a projector([a dlp printer][1]). Ever since then I've been tinkering with 3d printing.

- ### Linux and coding

    - I was introduced to Linux at the age of nine. My uncle installed ubuntu on an old computer and gave it to me to try. Suffice to say I was not impressed, but as I got older and gained interest in video games/computers, I returned to using Linux. The second Linux distro I used was [zorin][5], and I was surprised at how fast and stable it was compared to windows. Over the years I have learned valuable information on how Linux works which aided me with learning how to code. 

    - As an avid gamer, I wanted to know how games were made. In middle school, I picked up a book on python and started messing around with its interpreter. There was a lot of new terminology that I did not understand at the time. Variables, data types, function definitions, and classes were all foreign to me. I felt like a wizard printing messages to the terminal doing basic arithmatic with python. Becoming familarized with a programming language aided me thorughout high school and college and was a invaluable experience.

- ### Skills
    - proficient in Python3.0 and above along with C++ 

    - I can navigate and develop in Linux environment 

    - Setup servers and other hardware 

    - Troubleshoot IT 
    
    - Communicate and break down how hardware and software work to a end user
